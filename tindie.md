# How does it work?

Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) is a fancy term that means your skin changes its electrical properties when you sweat. When you get nervous or excited, your body sweats a tiny bit, even if you don't notice it. This sweat makes it easier for electricity to pass through your skin.

Now, think about when you're nervous—like when you're trying to figure out if someone you care about loves you back. You might sweat a little more, right? That's where Dr. Love comes in. 

Dr. Love measures this change in sweat using GSR. It has sensors that you place on your fingers or hand, which detect the slight increase in sweat and, therefore, the change in electrical conductivity of your skin. Dr. Love uses this GSR data to guess if someone is in love. If it detects a spike in sweating when you're near someone you love, it suggests that there might be some serious feelings involved.

This technology is used in lie detectors. You know, one of the quirks of lie detectors is their tendency to falter when someone's feeling a bit jittery or excited. But hey, I'm flipping that defect on its head and turning it into a plus. Why not? Think about it: when you're face-to-face with someone you adore, those heart-fluttering moments can easily send your nerves into overdrive. And guess what? That's exactly what I'm banking on with Dr. Love! We're taking those moments of excitement and turning them into a little game of love detection. It's like taking a glitch and turning it into a feature! 

But here's the kicker—if you're in a seasoned relationship, you might be cool as a cucumber and not sweat at all. That's why Dr. Love thoughtfully includes the phone number of a divorce lawyer on the cover, just in case!

# Conclusion

This project stemmed from the Hackaday business card challenge, sparking numerous brainstorming sessions with my wife to create something captivating and memorable, akin to the essence of a business card.

We envisioned the business card as a platform for exchanging impressions and fostering connections between two people. We wanted to offer a device that could reveal something about each person involved, transcending the conventional business card functionalities.

After exploring various ideas, we settled on the concept of a "love" detector, inspired by the notion of two individuals engaging in mutual interaction. Unlike a traditional lie detector, which can be tense and one-sided, we aimed to inject light-heartedness into the interaction by detecting "love" instead.

The idea struck a chord with our friends during testing, proving to be an effective attention-grabber and conversation starter. While Dr. Love may not be suitable for all business contexts, it excels in scenarios where a playful approach is welcomed and engagement is key.

Creating Dr. Love brought immense joy, and witnessing the enjoyment it brought to others was truly rewarding. It also shed light on the surprising reality that many married couples may not be as in love as one might assume, prompting us to include a real divorce lawyer's contact as a tongue-in-cheek addition.
